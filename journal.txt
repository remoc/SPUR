Week 1
Tuesday 7 June
-Downloaded and installed Rodin (and Atelier B Prover plugin).
-Started reading 'Modelling in Event-B' by Jean-Raymond Abrial.
-Did the Traffic Lights example from the Rodin Users Handbook.
-Started reading 'A Survey on Software Clone Detection Research' to look into code clones.
-Started reading 'Cakes, Custard + Category Theory' by Eugenia Cheng.

Wednesday 8 June
-Reading through Section 2.5 onwards in the Rodin Handbook (doing related examples: Agatha puzzle, Traffic Light refinement).

Thursday 9 June
-Finished Rodin Handbook Tutorial.
-Went through section 7 of the Code Clones paper.
-Attempted to start using Epsilon and the Transformation Patterns plugin in Rodin. 
-(Transformations plugin only seems to be available for an older version of Rodin).

Friday 10 June
-Downloaded older versions of Rodin (2.4 and 2.8) in an attempt to use Transformation Patterns. It worked eventually but whenever I open a .mode file (or look at the property window) I get null poiner errors from the UI (the property window and the palette, which is not convienent) and I am still figuring out how to make the Mode diagram.
-Looking into getting the EOL .ptrn files to work, not having much luck. Getting some kind of error from the plugin.
-Started reading 'EMF Eclipse Modeling Framework' 
-Tried some of the tutorial games on the Epsilon website to try to understand EOL better.

Week 2
Monday 13 June
-Took a closer look at the operations in the Transformation Patterns plugin. The system.eol file contains them
-Did an example of and EMF model to understand them better.
-Looking into EOL and EMF modelling of Event-B.
-Got the Rose editor plugin for Rodin, allowing me to save Event-B as XMI (the EMF Framework) (file is .xmb) but cannot open in Ecilpse as ecore model(not the same format).
-Reading more of the EMF book.
-Read 'Cakes, Custard + Category Theory'.

Tuesday 14 June
-Reading EMF book.
-Looking into Event B and Ecilspe.
-Found the ecore for Event B made for the EMF Framework plugin, and seeing what it looks like in Ecilspe by importing it.

Wednesday 15 June
-Trying to figure out the Event B ecore file, a bit stuck how to work with the generated code. Can make a machine and events, etc. by running as an Ecilpse application but cannot seem to name them. I am still unsure about how to import the .xmb file into the application.
-Read 'Cakes, Custard + Category Theory'.

Thursday 16 June
-Still not sure how I will put the .xmb files into ecilpse even with the ecore file.
-Looking at EMF compare within Rodin, has some errors (depending on the files you're comparing), but a good start to compare. Most errors appear in comparing the .xmb, but they have a nice model structure, which you don't get with the .buc/.bum file.
-Read more of 'Cakes, Custard + Category Theory'.
-Moved to the 4th year lab.

Friday 17 June
-Had meeting today at 11am, Andrew and Hao gave talks about what they were doing and it was interesting.
-Talked to James about where to go next, going to focus on getting .bum files to .xmb files 'headless'.
-Looking into accessing Rodin 'headlessly' and saving the files as .xmb.

Week 3
Monday 20 June
-Looking into making a plugin that can be used 'headlessly' that saves the files as .xmb. Have a lot of errors, just figuring out dependencies, because I am using code from a part of the EMF Event B Framework.
