Week 1
Tuesday 7 June
-Downloaded and installed Rodin (and Atelier B Prover plugin)
-Started reading 'Modelling in Event-B' by Jean-Raymond Abrial
-Did the Traffic Lights example from the Rodin Users Handbook
-Started reading 'A Survey on Software Clone Detection Research' to look into code clones
-Started reading 'Cakes, Custard + Category Theory' by Eugenia Cheng

Wednesday 8 June
-Reading through Section 2.5 onwards in the Rodin Handbook (doing related examples: Agatha puzzle, Traffic Light refinement).

Thursday 9 June
-Finished Rodin Handbook Tutorial
-Went through section 7 of the Code Clones paper 
-Attempted to start using Epsilon and the Transformation Patterns plugin in Rodin 
-(Transformations plugin only seems to be available for an older version of Rodin)

Friday 10 June
-Downloaded older versions of Rodin (2.4 and 2.8) in an attempt to use Transformation Patterns. It worked eventually but whenever I open a .mode file (or look at the property window) I get null poiner errors from the UI (the property window and the palette, which is not convienent) and I am still figuring out how to make the Mode diagram, I wonder if there is a way for it to generate itself because I am having problems understanding how to make it. I am also still trying to understand how to get the Transformation patterns to work with EOL, but I guess I have to understand the Mode before I can run transformations on them.
