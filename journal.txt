Week 1
Tuesday 7 June
-Downloaded and installed Rodin (and Atelier B Prover plugin).
-Started reading 'Modelling in Event-B' by Jean-Raymond Abrial.
-Did the Traffic Lights example from the Rodin Users Handbook.
-Started reading 'A Survey on Software Clone Detection Research' to look into code clones.
-Started reading 'Cakes, Custard + Category Theory' by Eugenia Cheng.

Wednesday 8 June
-Reading through Section 2.5 onwards in the Rodin Handbook (doing related examples: Agatha puzzle, Traffic Light refinement).

Thursday 9 June
-Finished Rodin Handbook Tutorial.
-Went through section 7 of the Code Clones paper.
-Attempted to start using Epsilon and the Transformation Patterns plugin in Rodin. 
-(Transformations plugin only seems to be available for an older version of Rodin).

Friday 10 June
-Downloaded older versions of Rodin (2.4 and 2.8) in an attempt to use Transformation Patterns. It worked eventually but whenever I open a .mode file (or look at the property window) I get null poiner errors from the UI (the property window and the palette, which is not convienent) and I am still figuring out how to make the Mode diagram.
-Looking into getting the EOL .ptrn files to work, not having much luck. Getting some kind of error from the plugin.
-Started reading 'EMF Eclipse Modeling Framework' 
-Tried some of the tutorial games on the Epsilon website to try to understand EOL better.

Week 2
Monday 13 June
-Took a closer look at the operations in the Transformation Patterns plugin. The system.eol file contains them
-Did an example of and EMF model to understand them better.
-Looking into EOL and EMF modelling of Event-B.
-Got the Rose editor plugin for Rodin, allowing me to save Event-B as XMI (the EMF Framework) (file is .xmb) but cannot open in Ecilpse as ecore model(not the same format).
-Reading more of the EMF book.
-Read 'Cakes, Custard + Category Theory'.

Tuesday 14 June
-Reading EMF book.
-Looking into Event B and Ecilspe.
-Found the ecore for Event B made for the EMF Framework plugin, and seeing what it looks like in Ecilspe by importing it.

Wednesday 15 June
-Trying to figure out the Event B ecore file, a bit stuck how to work with the generated code. Can make a machine and events, etc. by running as an Ecilpse application but cannot seem to name them. I am still unsure about how to import the .xmb file into the application.
-Read 'Cakes, Custard + Category Theory'.

Thursday 16 June
-Still not sure how I will put the .xmb files into ecilpse even with the ecore file.
-Looking at EMF compare within Rodin, has some errors (depending on the files you're comparing), but a good start to compare. Most errors appear in comparing the .xmb, but they have a nice model structure, which you don't get with the .buc/.bum file.
-Read more of 'Cakes, Custard + Category Theory'.
-Moved to the 4th year lab.

Friday 17 June
-Had meeting today at 11am, Andrew and Hao gave talks about what they were doing and it was interesting.
-Talked to James about where to go next, going to focus on getting .bum files to .xmb files 'headless'.
-Looking into accessing Rodin 'headlessly' and saving the files as .xmb.

Week 3
Monday 20 June
-Looking into making a plugin that can be used 'headlessly' that saves the files as .xmb. Have a lot of errors, just figuring out dependencies, because I am using code from a part of the EMF Event B Framework.

Tuesday 21 June
-Same as yesterday, have resolved most of the errors, having a problem with a plugin dependency. Need to figure out how to test it to see if it works.

Wednesday 22 June
-Solved some errors only to cause others, not sure if the code does what I think it does, need to test it soon.

Thursday 23 June
-Went to a meeting where Marie talked about what she was doing, and James told us about an interesting programming language Piets.
-Solved alot of the errors in my plugin with the help of Marie.

Friday 24 June
-Had a doctor's appointment.

Week 4
Monday 27 June
-Got sudo rights for my machine, got staff number and some other stuff sorted out.
-Still having problems making my plugin.
-Decided to try Ubuntu to see about Rodin headless build. Running into some problems.
-Ended up running the headless build. If this will allow me to run the plugin is the next question.

Tuesday 28 June
-Got an error free plugin, problems with headless Rodin. Going to adjust my focus more to finding the code clones.
-The answer to yesterday's question is a no... (at least for now)

Wednesday 29 June 
-Talked to Marie about my plugin, going to download a new version of eclipse to see if that changes anything and leave aside headless for now. Might try to easily incorporate into the UI?
-Taking a second look at the Code Clones paper. Need to see if EMF compare is a good way to find clones so I'm also taking a look through the code for it, to see what they ignore when making the comparisons.

Thursday 30 June
-Spent most of the day looking for resources for finding code clones, emf compare is good and bad, in that if they are not in the same order it will not notice the similarity of those two parts of the code. Most code clone detection programs seem to be for Java or C++.
-Trying to figure out what direction to take with the plugin, downloaded Eclipse on my laptop and that seems to have got rid of the problems Marie and I were looking at yesterday. Haven't got a working plugin yet though, might try to take a different direction, like mentioned above.
