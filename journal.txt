Week 1
Tuesday 7 June
-Downloaded and installed Rodin (and Atelier B Prover plugin)
-Started reading 'Modelling in Event-B' by Jean-Raymond Abrial
-Did the Traffic Lights example from the Rodin Users Handbook
-Started reading 'A Survey on Software Clone Detection Research' to look into code clones
-Started reading 'Cakes, Custard + Category Theory' by Eugenia Cheng

Wednesday 8 June
-Reading through Section 2.5 onwards in the Rodin Handbook (doing related examples: Agatha puzzle, Traffic Light refinement).

Thursday 9 June
-Finished Rodin Handbook Tutorial
-Went through section 7 of the Code Clones paper 
-Attempted to start using Epsilon and the Transformation Patterns plugin in Rodin 
-(Transformations plugin only seems to be available for an older version of Rodin)

Friday 10 June
-Downloaded older versions of Rodin (2.4 and 2.8) in an attempt to use Transformation Patterns. It worked eventually but whenever I open a .mode file (or look at the property window) I get null poiner errors from the UI (the property window and the palette, which is not convienent) and I am still figuring out how to make the Mode diagram.
-Looking into getting the EOL .ptrn files to work, not having much luck. Getting some kind of error from the plugin.
-Started reading 'EMF Eclipse Modeling Framework' 
-Tried some of the tutorial games on the Epsilon website to try to understand EOL better.

Week 2
Monday 13 June
-Took a closer look at the operations in the Transformation Patterns plugin. The system.eol file contains them
-Did an example of and EMF model to understand them better.
-Looking into EOL and EMF modelling of Event-B
-Got the Rose editor plugin for Rodin, allowing me to save Event-B as XMI (the EMF Framework) (file is .xmb) but cannot open in Ecilpse as ecore model(not the same format).
-Reading more of the EMF book.
-Read 'Cakes, Custard + Category Theory'.

Tuesday 14 June
-Reading EMF book
-Looking into Event B and Ecilspe
-Found the ecore for Event B made for the EMF Framework plugin, and seeing what it looks like in Ecilspe by importing it.

Wednesday 15 June
-Trying to figure out the Event B ecore file, a bit stuck how to work with the generated code. Can make a machine and events, etc. by running as an Ecilpse application but cannot seem to name them. I am still unsure about how to import the .xmb file into the application.
-Read 'Cakes, Custard + Category Theory'
